Excel Keyword Filter
By Steve Sande

This program searches a CSV file for rows containing custom keyword(s).
It was written as an independent learning exercise.

New CSV files will be created that are named after the keyword(s).
Rows containing an exact case-sensitive keyword match will be copied into their respective file.
Rows containing no keyword matches will be copied into a special file.
To account for case sensitivity include multiple keywords with the expected case variations.
Your inputs are limited to 100 characters per input.
Keyword(s) can include spaces, but not commas.

To use:
1. Navigate to x64 and then Release.
2. Run "Excel File Keyword Filter.exe".
3. Enter "&#60;yourpath&#62;\Excel-Keyword-Filter\Test Files\test.csv".
4. Enter "&#60;yourpath&#62;\Excel-Keyword-Filter\Test Files".
5. Enter "Guelph".
6. Enter "fish".
7. Enter nothing.
8. View results in the "Test Files" folder.
